## Key ideas

- Spotify Model; What works about it? What doesn't?
  - Cross-functional teams with same-function management
- Breaking down hierarchical, bureaucratic orgs
- Diversity
- Collective intelligence
- Remote, the power of async communication/work

## Concrete learnings

1. Do split up work, and trust in your team mates' abilities (freight ship/speed boat metaphor)
2. Do reflections and invite feedback early and often
3. Each crew has a personality that is formed by the voices
4. Real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time
5. Me time and we time should be considered

## Questions

On Shape-Up

- Missing different perspectives, integrating disciplines and (ethnical) backgrounds
- Still feels pretty top-down, how might we let information flow to and from shapers?

General

- What's the currency within the culture? What gets traded and causes people to act?
- Persuading people that "we" is better than "me"

## Quotes

### McKinsey Traditional company, new businesses

#### Change is accelerating

Modern businesses have to respond to changing business conditions at an increasing rate. As a result, business process modelling and improvement is becoming a serious challenge (Hillenbrand et al., 2019). As established companies get thrown over by digital powerhouses many are reinventing themselves through a dual effort to digitise their legacy businesses and create new enterprises (Hillenbrand et al., 2019).

Innovation like this requires seamless collaboration across different parts of a business. In most large corporations however, innovation and integration are unnatural acts. The resistance of large enterprises represses new ideas, and their siloed nature hinders cross-functional cooperation (Cash, Earl and Morison, 2008). McKinsey also observed, that rather than a shortage of inspiration, older companies‚Äô main challenges are an excess of institutional control and an inability to scale up innovations. So, what is the key to a resilient, fast-changing organisation?

#### Innovation-labs

McKinsey has identified an essential process to successfully build resilience against disruption, an in- house innovation-lab. Their purpose; building and scaling up their own disruptive new businesses, that many corporates and incubators normally don‚Äôt. Their success is three-fold:

- Collect resources and talent to steer the early stages of growth
- Act as a buffer that shields them from the bureaucratic nature of enterprises
- Reap the benefits of the parent company‚Äôs scale

#### Formula for success

A winning formula for building new businesses combines the methods and pace of successful tech start-ups with the scale of long-standing companies.

- Large market that can be unlocked in incremental steps
- Technology model that takes advantage of ecosystems
- Clear path toward attractive monetisation

## Quotes

> Be stubborn on the vision, but flexible on the details
>
> - Jeff Bezos

#### Basecamp: How We Communicate

> Few things are as important to study, practice, and perfect as clear communication
>
> - [source](https://basecamp.com/guides/how-we-communicate)

#### Shape Up

> We needed language to describe what we were doing and more structure to keep doing it at our new scale

Balance between formalizing and autonomy:

> We formalized our pitching and betting processes

Relate to this with hyper‚Äôs short projects:

> \[S\]ix-week cycles. Six weeks is long enough to build something meaningful start-to-finish and short enough that everyone can feel the deadline looming from the start

Again, autonomy vs agency:

> \[R\]ight level of abstraction: concrete enough that the teams know what to do, yet abstract enough that they have room to work out the interesting details themselves

> \[S\]peak frankly and jump from one promising position to another. It‚Äôs that kind of private, rough, early work

> An appetite is completely different from an estimate. Estimates start with a design and end with a number. Appetites start with a number and end with a design. We use the appetite as a creative constraint on the design process

Hard decision to make, but really powerful:

> If it‚Äôs not critical now and we can‚Äôt get our hands around the problem, we‚Äôll walk away from it and work on something else. Maybe in the future a new request or story will pop up that gives us better insight into the problem

#### Spotify Culture

> Culture tends to be invisible. We don't notice it, because it's there all the time.
>
> - Henrik Kniberg <Citation id="spotifyCulture" hideAuthor />

> Agile matters more than scrum, and agile principles matter more than specific scrum practices
>

Autonomy is motivating, and motivated people build better stuff
The vision of Spotify is more important than any squad. The goal is to be autonomous, but don' t suboptimize:

> It's kind of like a jazz-band. Although each musician is autonomous and plays his own instrument. They listen to each other and focus on the whole song together.

Loosely coupled, but tightly aligned squads.

Cross-pollination > standardisation.

<small>
  Note: that's how Figma, Slack and Google's Design Sprint became big.
</small>

Community > hierarchical structure. Strong community can get away with an informal, volatile structure.

> If you need to know exactly who is making decisions, you are in the wrong place.

#### Social Life of Information

> In a similar vein, there‚Äôs been a lot of talk about organizational ‚Äúculture‚Äù and members‚Äô ‚Äúidentity‚Äù as if these were uniform, too. \[...\] Both culture and identity are significant aspects of learning and knowledge.
>
> - John Seely Brown <Citation id="socialInformation" page="143-144" hideAuthor />

> \[A\] work identity, even in multinational firms, is to a significant degree formed locally, where practitioners work together and practice is interdependent.

> - John Seely Brown <Citation id="socialInformation" page="144" hideAuthor />

Large organizations stand little chance of forging much of a common identity. Its members are too diverse, too deeply engaged in different practices, and located in too many places. Employees, then, don‚Äôt simply become members of the Xerox Corporation. They become members of its different communities of practice‚Äîtechnical representatives, engineers, research managers, or sales analysts.

The creation of local knowledge, then, is likely to create simultaneously problems for coordination. In general, the formal requirements of process and a little creative ‚Äúprocessing‚Äù (see chapter four) smooths over such problems. As a

Result, they are likely to dampen (or at least make invisible) creativity.

### Group Flow

> \[E\]xtremely creative people are at their peak when they experience ‚Äúa unified flowing from one moment to the next, in which we feel in control of our actions, and in which there is little distinction between self and environment; between stimulus and response; or between past, present, and future.‚Äù They get so absorbed in the task that they lose track of time. Creative people, in all professions and all walks of life, have their most significant insights while in a flow state.

> Csikszentmihalyi found that the most common place people experienced flow was in conversation with others.

> \[I\]mprovising groups attain a collective state of mind that I call group flow.

> \[I\]t‚Äôs more important than ever for a group to be able to merge action and awareness, to adjust immediately by improvising. In group flow, activity becomes spontaneous, and the group acts without thinking about it first.

> \[T\]he single biggest barrier to effective team performance was unclear objectives.

> If the goal is well-understood and can be explicitly stated, it‚Äôs a problem- solving creative task.

> Jazz and improv groups are at the other extreme. The only goal is intrinsic to the performance itself‚Äîto perform well and to entertain the audience. This is problem-finding creativity because the group has to ‚Äúfind‚Äù and define the problem as they‚Äôre solving it.

> In group flow, the group is focused on the natural progress emerging from their work, not on meeting a deadline set by management. Flow is more likely to occur when attention is centered on the task, and other things are put out of mind. Small annoyances aren‚Äôt noticed, and the external rewards that may or may not await at the end of the task are forgotten.

> The key to improvised innovation is managing a paradox: establishing a goal that provides focus for the team‚Äîjust enough focus so that team members can tell when they get closer to a solution‚Äî but one that‚Äôs open-ended enough for problem-finding creativity to emerge

> Group flow is more likely to emerge when everyone is fully engaged‚Äîwhat improvisers call ‚Äúdeep listening‚Äù.

> your statements are genuinely unplanned responses to what you hear
