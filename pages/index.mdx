A big part of that reinvention is reimagining the way companies work. With many developments in this space, especially since the creation of the Agile Manifesto <Citation id="agileManifesto" />, new ways of working have come to light in recent years. The manifesto favours:

1. _Individuals and interactions_ over processes and tools
2. _Working software_ over comprehensive documentation
3. _Customer collaboration_ over contract negotiation
4. _Responding to change_ over following a plan

Ultimately, that means working methodologies of the past (most notably; waterfall) have slowly disappeared in working businesses. This way of working has also changed how culture and information disperse in an organisation.

## How Agile, Lean and Design Thinking work together

Victor Essnert of Doberman <Citation id="agileDoberman" /> explained the issues agile aims to solve and how it works better together with Design Thinking and Lean.

He explains how each of these mindsets help us with a mental framework at a specific stage during product development.

1. *Design Thinking* is about exploring and solving problems
2. *Lean* is to test and learn on our way to the right outcomes
3. *Agile* is how we adapt to the ever-changing conditions we work in (especially with software) 

## What is culture?

> Culture tends to be invisible. We don't notice it, because it's there all the time.

> - Henrik Kniberg <Citation id="spotifyCulture" hideAuthor />

> Few things are as important to study, practice, and perfect as clear communication
>
> - Jason Fried <Citation id="basecampComms" hideAuthor />

## Autonomy & Alignment

> Be stubborn on the vision, but flexible on the details

> - Jeff Bezos

## Effective teams

- Four stages of group development <Citation id="wheelanEffective" />
  - Dependency and inclusion
  - Counter-dependency and fighting
  - Trust and structure
  - Work and productivity
- Focus on 10 things:
  - Goals
  - Rules
  - Interdependence
  - Leadership
  - Communication and feedback
  - Discussion
  - Decision making and planning
  - Implementation and evaluation
  - Norms and individual differences
  - Structure
  - Cooperation and conflict management

Cross-functional

Sawyer <Citation id="sawyerFlow" /> establishes ideal conditions for group flow: group goals, close listening, complete concentration, being in control, blending egos, equal participation, knowing team mates, good communication, and being progress-oriented.

## Collective Intelligence

- Persuading how we is better than me

## Looking at others

There are two organizations I've been particularly interested in when it comes to work processes and methodologies. *Basecamp* and *Spotify*. The founders and employees of Basecamp have released several books and documents that explain their way of working. Spotify on the other hand, was applauded back in 2014, for the work processes they employ.

### Basecamp

### Spotify

## Remote

> Real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time.

## Research

### Key ideas

- Spotify Model; What works about it? What doesn't?
  - Cross-functional teams with same-function management
- Breaking down hierarchical, bureaucratic orgs
- Diversity
- Collective intelligence
- Remote, the power of async communication/work

### Concrete learnings

1. Do split up work, and trust in your team mates' abilities (freight ship/speed boat metaphor)
2. Do reflections and invite feedback early and often
3. Each crew has a personality that is formed by the voices
4. Real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time
5. Me time and we time should be considered

### Questions

On Shape-Up

- Missing different perspectives, integrating disciplines and (ethnical) backgrounds
- Still feels pretty top-down, how might we let information flow to and from shapers?

General

- What's the currency within the culture? What gets traded and causes people to act?
- Persuading people that "we" is better than "me"

### Quotes

### McKinsey Traditional company, new businesses

#### Change is accelerating

Modern businesses have to respond to changing business conditions at an increasing rate. As a result, business process modelling and improvement is becoming a serious challenge (Hillenbrand et al., 2019). As established companies get thrown over by digital powerhouses many are reinventing themselves through a dual effort to digitise their legacy businesses and create new enterprises (Hillenbrand et al., 2019).

Innovation like this requires seamless collaboration across different parts of a business. In most large corporations however, innovation and integration are unnatural acts. The resistance of large enterprises represses new ideas, and their siloed nature hinders cross-functional cooperation (Cash, Earl and Morison, 2008). McKinsey also observed, that rather than a shortage of inspiration, older companies’ main challenges are an excess of institutional control and an inability to scale up innovations. So, what is the key to a resilient, fast-changing organisation?

#### Innovation-labs

McKinsey has identified an essential process to successfully build resilience against disruption, an in- house innovation-lab. Their purpose; building and scaling up their own disruptive new businesses, that many corporates and incubators normally don’t. Their success is three-fold:

- Collect resources and talent to steer the early stages of growth
- Act as a buffer that shields them from the bureaucratic nature of enterprises
- Reap the benefits of the parent company’s scale

#### Formula for success

A winning formula for building new businesses combines the methods and pace of successful tech start-ups with the scale of long-standing companies.

- Large market that can be unlocked in incremental steps
- Technology model that takes advantage of ecosystems
- Clear path toward attractive monetisation
