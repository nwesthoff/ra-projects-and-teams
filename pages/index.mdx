introduction: "Modern businesses have to respond to changing business conditions at an increasing rate. As a result, business process modelling and improvement is becoming a serious challenge. As established companies get thrown over by digital powerhouses many are forced to reinvent themselves."

A big part of that reinvention is reimagining the way companies work <Citation id="mckinseyInnovation" />. With many developments in this space, especially since the creation of the Agile Manifesto <Citation id="agileManifesto" />, new ways of working have come to light in recent years. Working methodologies of the past (most notably; waterfall) have slowly disappeared in favour of ones that are better at responding to change. This way of working has also changed how culture and information disperse in an organisation.

## How Agile, Lean and Design Thinking work together

Let's start by looking into new working methodologies and mindsets. The resistance of large enterprises represses new ideas, and their siloed nature hinders cross-functional cooperation <Citation id="hbrEnterpriseInnovation" page="90-100" />. So, what is the key to a resilient, fast-changing organisation?

Victor Essnert of Doberman <Citation id="agileDoberman" /> explained the issues agile aims to solve. The Agile manifesto favours:

1. _Individuals and interactions_ over processes and tools
2. _Working software_ over comprehensive documentation
3. _Customer collaboration_ over contract negotiation
4. _Responding to change_ over following a plan

Victor continued his breakdown by showing how Agile works better together with Design Thinking and Lean. He explains how each of these mindsets help us with a mental framework at a specific stage during product development.

1. _Design Thinking_ is about exploring and solving problems
2. _Lean_ is to test and learn on our way to the right outcomes
3. _Agile_ is how we adapt to the ever-changing conditions we work in (especially with software)

At Hyper Island, we've been following many of Agile's principles too. Resilience — being able to respond to change — has been a central part of our curriculum. We have been handed several tools to do that together as a team, underpinned by Susan Wheelan's theory for *creating effective teams*. 

## Effective Teams

- Four stages of group development <Citation id="wheelanEffective" />
  1. Dependency and inclusion
  2. Counter-dependency and fighting
  3. Trust and structure
  4. Work and productivity
- Focus on 10 things:
  - Goals
  - Rules
  - Interdependence
  - Leadership
  - Communication and feedback
  - Discussion
  - Decision making and planning
  - Implementation and evaluation
  - Norms and individual differences
  - Structure
  - Cooperation and conflict management

Cross-functional

Sawyer <Citation id="sawyerFlow" /> establishes ideal conditions for group flow: group goals, close listening, complete concentration, being in control, blending egos, equal participation, knowing team mates, good communication, and being progress-oriented.

## What is Culture?

Now that we know how (some) organizations and effective teams work, we can start to look into how the *people* in these teams work. 

> Culture tends to be invisible. We don't notice it, because it's there all the time.

> Few things are as important to study, practice, and perfect as clear communication

At Spotify, they favour community over hierarchical structure. Strong community can get away with an informal, volatile structure <Citation id="spotifyCulture" />. This ultimately leads us into the obvious question; *How do we maintain productivity without hierarchical structure?* To answer this, we have to look into how autonomy interacts with alignment within organizations.

## Autonomy & Alignment

Autonomy is motivating, and motivated people build better stuff <Citation id="spotifyCulture" />

> Be stubborn on the vision, but flexible on the details
>
> - Jeff Bezos

## Collective Intelligence

- How knowledge and information spreads
- Cross-pollination over standardization
  - That's how Figma, Slack and Google's Design Sprint became big
- Persuading how we is better than me

## Looking at Others

There are two organizations I've been particularly interested in when it comes to work processes and methodologies. _Basecamp_ and _Spotify_. The founders and employees of Basecamp have released several books and documents that explain their way of working. Spotify on was applauded when they shared the work processes they employ in 2014 <Citation id="spotifyCulture" />.
