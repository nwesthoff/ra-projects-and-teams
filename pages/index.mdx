## Key ideas

- Spotify Model --> What works about it? What doesn't?
- Breaking down hierarchical, bureaucratic orgs
- Diversity
- Remote, the power of async communication/work

## Concrete learnings

1. Do split up work, and trust in your team mates's abilities (freight ship/speed boat metaphor)
2. Do reflections and invite feedback early and often

## Questions

On Shape-Up

- Missing different perspectives, integrating disciplines and (ethnical) backgrounds
- Still feels pretty top-down, how might we let information flow to and from shapers?

## Quotes

> We needed language to describe what we were doing and more structure to keep doing it at our new scale

Balance between formalizing and autonomy:

> We formalized our pitching and betting processes

Relate to this with hyper’s short projects:

> \[S\]ix-week cycles. Six weeks is long enough to build something meaningful start-to-finish and short enough that everyone can feel the deadline looming from the start

Again, autonomy vs agency:

> \[R\]ight level of abstraction: concrete enough that the teams know what to do, yet abstract enough that they have room to work out the interesting details themselves

> \[S\]peak frankly and jump from one promising position to another. It’s that kind of private, rough, early work

> An appetite is completely different from an estimate. Estimates start with a design and end with a number. Appetites start with a number and end with a design. We use the appetite as a creative constraint on the design process

Hard decision to make, but really powerful:

> If it’s not critical now and we can’t get our hands around the problem, we’ll walk away from it and work on something else. Maybe in the future a new request or story will pop up that gives us better insight into the problem
