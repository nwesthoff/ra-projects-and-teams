## Key ideas

- Spotify Model --> What works about it? What doesn't?
- Breaking down hierarchical, bureaucratic orgs
- Diversity
- Remote, the power of async communication/work

## Concrete learnings

1. Do split up work, and trust in your team mates's abilities (freight ship/speed boat metaphor)
2. Do reflections and invite feedback early and often
3. Real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time

## Questions

On Shape-Up

- Missing different perspectives, integrating disciplines and (ethnical) backgrounds
- Still feels pretty top-down, how might we let information flow to and from shapers?

## Quotes

### Shape Up

> You can not not communicate. Not discussing the elephant in the room is communicating. Few things are as important to study, practice, and perfect as clear communication
>
> - [source](https://basecamp.com/guides/how-we-communicate)

> We needed language to describe what we were doing and more structure to keep doing it at our new scale

Balance between formalizing and autonomy:

> We formalized our pitching and betting processes

Relate to this with hyper’s short projects:

> \[S\]ix-week cycles. Six weeks is long enough to build something meaningful start-to-finish and short enough that everyone can feel the deadline looming from the start

Again, autonomy vs agency:

> \[R\]ight level of abstraction: concrete enough that the teams know what to do, yet abstract enough that they have room to work out the interesting details themselves

> \[S\]peak frankly and jump from one promising position to another. It’s that kind of private, rough, early work

> An appetite is completely different from an estimate. Estimates start with a design and end with a number. Appetites start with a number and end with a design. We use the appetite as a creative constraint on the design process

Hard decision to make, but really powerful:

> If it’s not critical now and we can’t get our hands around the problem, we’ll walk away from it and work on something else. Maybe in the future a new request or story will pop up that gives us better insight into the problem

### Spotify Culture

> Culture tends to be invisible. We don't notice it, because it's there all the time.

> Agile matters more than scrum, and principles matter more than specific scrum practices

Autonomy is motivating, and motivated people build better stuff
The vision of Spotify is more important than any squad. The goal is to be autonomous, but don' t suboptimize:

> It's kind of like a jazz-band. Although each musician is autonomous and plays his own instrument. They listen to each other and focus on the whole song together.

Loosely coupled, but tightligh aligned squads.

Cross-pollination > standardization. Note: that's how Figma and Slack became big.
Community > hierarchical structure. Strong community can get away with an informal, volatile structure.

> If you need to know exactly who is making decisions, you are in the wrong place.
