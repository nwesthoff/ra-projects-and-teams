A big part of that reinvention is reimagining the way companies work <Citation id="mckinseyInnovation" />. With many developments in this space, especially since the creation of the Agile Manifesto <Citation id="agileManifesto" />, new ways of working have come to light in recent years. Working methodologies of the past (most notably; waterfall) have slowly disappeared in favour of ones that are better at responding to change. This way of working has also changed how ideas and information disperse in an organisation.

This research activity deconstructs organizations atomically. Meaning; we start by looking at the big picture, then zooming in. Thereafter we consider how this influences the way information spreads within an organization.

## Agile, Lean & Design Thinking — Better Together

Let's start by looking at modern working methodologies and mindsets. The resistance of large enterprises represses new ideas, and their siloed nature hinders cross-functional cooperation <Citation id="hbrEnterpriseInnovation" page="90-100" />. So, what is the key to a resilient, fast-changing organisation?

Victor Essnert of Doberman <Citation id="agileDoberman" /> explained the issues agile aims to solve. The Agile manifesto favours:

1. _Individuals and interactions_ over processes and tools
2. _Working software_ over comprehensive documentation
3. _Customer collaboration_ over contract negotiation
4. _Responding to change_ over following a plan

Victor continued his breakdown by showing how Agile works better together with Design Thinking and Lean. He explains how each of these mindsets help us with a mental framework at a specific stage during product development.

1. _Design Thinking_ is about exploring and solving problems
2. _Lean_ is to test and learn on our way to the right outcomes
3. _Agile_ is how we adapt to the ever-changing conditions we work in (especially with software)

At Hyper Island, we've been following many of Agile's principles too. Resilience — being able to respond to change — has been a central part of our curriculum. This has been deeply engrained in the culture of our crew.

## What is Culture?

John Seely Brown argues both _culture_ and _identity_ are significant aspects of learning and knowledge <Citation id="socialInformation" page="143-144" />. The culture of an organization is often hard to define. One issue is the invisibility of culture, as described by Spotify's Henrik Kniberg:

> Culture tends to be invisible. We don't notice it, because it's there all the time.
>
> - Henrik Kniberg <Citation id="spotifyCulture" hideAuthor />

Culture is something we have to actively look for in order to understand, analyse and change it.

Vimla Appadoo envisions culture as a bubble that sits around the systems, processes and people of an organization. Culture is what guides us to make decisions about the systems and processes we use. It empowers people to deliver their best work. She also voices three levels of culture, that fit in one another like a babushka doll <Citation id="appadooCulture" />.

1. *Personal culture*: all the things that make us diverse and unique
2. *Team Culture*: how a bunch of individuals work together to produce spectacular work
3. *Business culture*: how lots of teams work together, often united by their values

At Spotify, they favour community over hierarchical structure. Strong community can get away with an informal, volatile structure <Citation id="spotifyCulture" />. This ultimately leads us into the obvious question; _How do we maintain productivity without hierarchical structure?_ To answer this, we have to look into how autonomy interacts with alignment within organizations.

## Autonomy and Productivity

Kniberg says autonomy is motivating and motivated people build better stuff <Citation id="spotifyCulture" />. That sounds compelling, but how do we ensure the vision of the company doesn't water down? How do we find the right balance between autonomy and being productive? It's easy to be hesitant towards autonomous, self-organised teams. Research addresses a perceived security in following traditional, hierarchical chains of command under the guise of reducing risks and maintaining efficiency <Citation id="parkerSelfOrganised" />.

### Self-organised Teams

Self-organised teams are self-regulated, semi-autonomous teams. Their members plan and manage their day-to-day activities and responsibilities under reduced or no supervision <Citation id="parkerSelfOrganised" />. At Hyper Island I have implemented the _daily facilitator_, essentially rotating leadership daily. This has been able to tamper louder voices within the team and drawing out responsibility from the quieter ones. This is backed by research as well; imperial (authoritative) leadership is associated with lower levels of voice, cooperation and performance <Citation id="erezRotating" />. Rotating leadership works by alternating decision control. It harnesses the complimentary capabilities of each team member and deepens and broadens our search for potential innovations <Citation id="davisRotating" />. That doesn't mean top-down leadership disappears completely. However, the role of senior leadership changes.

### Autonomy & Alignment

Smith and Sharma think of this in two dimensions; autonomy and alignment. Autonomy is the amount of freedom teams get, to work on the tasks they are motivated by. Alignment is about the vision of the company. Intra-team alignment ensures they aren't running in circles like headless chickens. Smith and Sharma define the _alignment-autonomy framework_, it categorizes what each of these environments might look like <Citation id="smithResponsibility" />.

1. _Low autonomy_ and _low alignment_: a typical micro-management culture; "shut up and follow orders"
2. _Low autonomy_ and _high alignment_: leaders are able to communicate the problem but also tell people how to solve it.
3. _High autonomy_ and _low alignment_: teams do whatever they want, leaders are helpless and the product becomes a Frankenstein
4. _High autonomy_ and _high alignment_: leaders define the problem, but let the teams figure out how to solve it

Spotify details how they apply this knowledge in practice. The last environment, one of high autonomy and high alignment is what they call _aligned autonomy_. Effective leadership for them is about creating strong alignment, which affords them to grant more autonomy to their teams <Citation id="spotifyCulture" />.

### Harmonizing as a team

On a smaller scale, individuals must develop a responsibility and leadership. Smith and Sharma define three key elements that, once appropriately defined, attract leadership and responsibility <Citation id="smithResponsibility" />. Adequately defining these elements would grant autonomy to working teams.

</Image>

1. _Focus_: defined and clear goals for the business and team
2. _Will_: finding meaning and purpose in the work
3. _Capability_: adequately skilled team members, availability of resources

### Shaping Work

_Shape Up_ solidifies lots of these ideas. Ryan Singer describes that _'shaped work'_ needs to find the right balance between concrete and abstract. The right level of abstraction is:

> \[C\]oncrete enough that the teams know what to do, yet abstract enough that they have room to work out the interesting details themselves
>
> - Ryan Singer <Citation id="shapeUp" hideAuthor />

Shaped work _shouldn't_ define what the result looks like, but should _clearly_ define the intended functionality or goal. They are clearly defined, rough ideas. Moreover, they define creative constraints and specify where the work ends. Shape Up enforces this by a mechanic Singer calls _appetite_. The shaping of work can't be planned or predicted, but shaped work can. Appetite settles how long we are willing to spend on the work. It makes us ask ourselves how much time this idea is worth to us, before mindlessly starting the work because we're excited about it <Citation id="shapeUp" />.

I've noticed that I've been doing this at Hyper Island too (especially during later projects). Our team would define tasks with some level of abstraction and refining the work individually or in smaller groups. We've essentially been shaping our own work together, which allowed us to split up work effectively. A prerequisite for this to succeed is that we trust each member will put in the work. The Hyper Island staff has handed us several tools to align as a team, underpinned by Susan Wheelan's theory for _creating effective teams_.

## Effective Teams

How team members behave is critical to the success of the team and significantly affects how knowledge is received. There are many factors to take into account when compiling a new team. What would an effective team look like? How should they act? Who are the people in an effective team? One lens to increase our understanding of effective teams is Wheelan's _Integrated Model of Group Dynamics_ (IMGD). She defines four stages of group development <Citation id="wheelanEffective" />.

Teams working together move through several stages as they continue working together. Team development looks different for every team and won't necessarily happen in a linear fashion. They may go through all of these stages, or only a few. Many groups will get stuck at some point. Even teams that have been working together effectively for a long time may (temporarily) regress as well.

### Team Termination

Additionally, Wheelan <Citation id="wheelanEffective" hideAuthor /> defines a fifth stage; termination. While this technically isn't a development stage, it's still an important step in team development. By consciously disbanding a team, we extract our learnings and give team members a sense of closure. Team termination concerns these points:

- Evaluating how successful the team was
- Evaluating how well the group functioned
- Expressing emotional support for team members
- Giving and receiving feedback to and from team members

### Focus of Effective Teams

Furthermore, Wheelan <Citation id="wheelanEffective" hideAuthor /> determined effective teams focus on 10 things:

1. Goals
2. Rules
3. Interdependence
4. Leadership
5. Communication and feedback
6. Discussion, decision making and planning
7. Implementation and evaluation
8. Norms and individual differences
9. Structure
10. Cooperation and conflict management

### Constructing an Effective Team

With these points, Wheelan <Citation id="wheelanEffective" hideAuthor /> address what effective teams focus on. However, it does not tell us anything about the building blocks of an effective team, the people within it. Decades of research show _socially diverse_ groups are more innovative than groups that lack diversity. Groups with a diversity of race, ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation are better at solving complex, nonroutine problems than homogeneous groups <Citation id="phillipsDiversity" />. Simply by interacting with individuals with unique perspectives, makes people believe that differences of perspective may exist. Non-diverse groups perceive unique information as straight-forward and generally spend less time on a task, rushing to the (often wrong) solution <Citation id="phillipsSurface" />. By working in a diverse team, we are forced to prepare and anticipate alternative perspectives, before reaching consensus.

### Group Flow

Flow is a well established concept in psychology, done so by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi <Citation id="csikszentmihalyiFlow" hideAuthor />. Flow is defined as an optimal experience; a challenging activity that requires skill. They're activities that are goal-directed and bounded by rules. When flow state is reached, it completely consumes what we're doing and makes time pass without us noticing. Robert Keith Sawyer applies this same concept to groups <Citation id="sawyerFlow" />. He outlines ideal conditions for _group flow_ as:

1. Group goals
2. Close listening
3. Complete concentration
4. Being in control
5. Blending egos
6. Equal participation
7. Knowing team mates
8. Good communication
9. Being progress-oriented

People experience flow most commonly when in conversation with others, Csikszentmihalyi found. When this occurs, statements are genuinely unplanned responses to what we hear <Citation id="csikszentmihalyiFlow" hideAuthor />. Consequently, _group flow_ is more likely to emerge when everyone is fully engaged — at Hyper Island we call this _active listening_ <Citation id="sawyerFlow" />.

## Communication

When we zoom in even further, we see communication as the fabric that connects how teams work. Basecamp, a company that works 100% remotely, spends a lot effort to improve team work, culture and communication. In their list of principles, called _"How We Communicate"_, co-founder Jason Fried writes:

> Few things are as important to study, practice, and perfect as clear communication
>
> - Jason Fried <Citation id="basecampComms" hideAuthor />

While Fried is mostly focused on reducing communication, favouring asynchronous modes of communication over meetings, I think studying the way we communicate can be done on a wider scale. Being able to speak the same language is a big part of that.

### Project & Reflect

Appropriately kicking off new projects (with a new team) can significantly impact the perception team members have on the work ahead. By _projecting_ ourselves forward and opening a conversation on the previously mentioned focus, will and capability, teams are able to foster leadership from within <Citation id="smithResponsibility" />. Concretely, addressing purpose, desired outcomes, values, roles and skills with the team we're more resilient to the issues that lie ahead.

During and upon concluding projects, there are opportunities to _reflect_. This creates a level playing field and develops openness within a group. By forcing team members to put their fears and anxieties on the table, individuals are able to relate better to one another. They become more comfortable with sharing deep feelings. This reciprocity of sharing fears forms trust and with trust we're able to share work we feel insecure about too, promoting creative output.

### Asynchronous

People are social creatures, so at the same time it is easy to over-communicate as well. Communication in a working environment easily interrupts work and valuing each others' time is vital. Updating team mates on progress is important, but asking them to follow every step of the way is a distraction. At Basecamp they are big advocates of asynchronous communication.

> Real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time.
>
> - Jason Fried <Citation id="basecampComms" hideAuthor />

Their main argument is that verbal means of communication cost more time to multiple people. During meetings, the barrier to interrupt an argument is lower, which easily spins a discussion away from the goal at hand.

> Writing solidifies, chat dissolves.
>
> - Jason Fried <Citation id="basecampComms" hideAuthor />

While not everyone will agree with me, in my personal work at Hyper Island I've experienced this as well. Sharing research often played out as listing _everything_ we had found, causing us to run over our timebox. I suspect sharing this through writing or drawing would have prevented interruptions and delayed questions or judgement. The discussions we'd have had would have been more meaningful and fruitful. Definitely something I'm willing to try in the future.

### Balance

It's good to be weary that it's possible to overcompensate for this too. Vimla Appadoo, guest speaker at Hyper Island, bravely shared one of her biggest mistakes starting at her new job was:

> Over doing and under communicating
>
> - Vimla Appadoo <Citation id="vimlaMistakes" hideAuthor />

She mentions how she used to work in isolation, fixated on doing the work. Leading to the alienation of some co-workers, especially those unfamiliar with design practice. As previously established, conversation is an environment where lots of people find flow. While it's important to aim for effective communication, unstructured and casual _watercooler conversations_ are also a source of new ideas and sharing knowledge. Conversation is where information meets, crosses boundaries and where new ways of thinking flourish.

## Collective Intelligence

At large organizations there is little chance of a common identity. The people within them are too diverse, deeply engaged in different practices and spatially disconnected. Information and knowledge is formed locally and stored in a decentral clusters, as John Seely Brown explains in _The Social Life of Information_ <Citation id="socialInformation" page="144" hideAuthor />.

> \[A\] work identity, even in multinational firms, is to a significant degree formed locally, where practitioners work together and practice is interdependent.
>
> - John Seely Brown <Citation id="socialInformation" page="144" hideAuthor />

Brown suggests ideas emerge where people come together, networks of practice help diffusing ideas through different organizations.

### How we becomes better than me

Let's regard the knowledge within an organization as a collective brain. Suddenly it seems useful to connect its neurons and synapses in as many directions as possible. The shorter the connection to useful information is within an organization, the easier it is to access and harness it. I think this is a partial explanation of Spotify's successful culture. At Spotify, day-to-day work is done in cross-functional teams. However, they are connected through larger collections of teams (called tribes) and coached by function. There are lots of opportunities for knowledge to spread and thrive. Their culture favours cross-pollination over standardization, the strongest connection survive <Citation id="spotifyCulture" />. This has slowly been taking off within our crew at Hyper Island, albeit at a smaller scale. Everyone in our crew has worked in several teams now, connecting knowledge from previous experiences to the next. It has linked our varying skillsets throughout the crew. A concrete example is how both _Digital Management_ and _Digital Experience Design_ have shared their lens into the world with each other.

## Remote

_Work-from-home_ has been slowly gaining traction over the past few decades <Citation id="felsteadRemote" />. Though this year we have all — unfortunately had to — become experts at remote work. Many of us have been blessed by high speed internet and the existence of online collaboration tools. Tools like Zoom, Miro and Keynote Live allow us to keep working together, even when physically apart.

### Watercooler Moments

Unfortunately these tools do not reduce the this distance between us and it's unable to solve some of the problems this separation creates. Virtual environments deprive us from the learning we used to be able to get from peers outside of class <Citation id="socialInformation" page="140-145" />. Rob Potts (our programme leader at Hyper Island) emphasized the importance of these _watercooler moments_ we used to have while working together in the studio. It's where we used to bump into each other by chance, where we used to talk about how awful the water tastes in the UK and where we discussed what to eat for lunch. In remote collaboration the way we're able to _instantly_ and _spontaneously_ bond over something as simple as coffee lacks <Citation id="gorlenkoRemote" />. The lack of behavioural cues force us to rely on verbal communication mostly. I have personally observed that adjusting to this new reality is clearly more difficult to some than others.

### Remote Work Intensity

While working-from-home generally shows higher job satisfaction and job-related well-being, the current circumstances likely dampen many of these benefits. Simultaneously remote employees show more commitment and are generally more task-focused. By working in the same space as we eat, sleep and live in, the experience of work intensifies. As a result, it's harder for us to switch off from work <Citation id="felsteadRemote" />.

Ultimately, we have to recognize the differences remote work creates. Agile companies are more likely to successfully adapt and overcome these issues. I'm interested to see how society changes as a whole. To learn about the way we learn from each other in a distributed future.

## Conclusion

I used to think the strongest argument the Agile manifesto poses is being ready to change. I do think however, that after my experience at Hyper Island and analysing modern businesses practices, this has changed a bit. Resilience to change is not a goal, but an outcome. Not only are modern businesses learning more iteratively than before. They have more effectively been able to connect knowledge throughout their organisation. This has empowered businesses to respond to change better.
