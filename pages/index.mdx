## Key ideas

- Spotify Model --> What works about it? What doesn't?
- Breaking down hierarchical, bureaucratic orgs
- Diversity

## Concrete learnings

1. Do split up work, and trust in your team mates's abilities (freight ship/speed boat metaphor)
2. Do reflections and invite feedback early and often
