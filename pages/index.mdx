A big part of that reinvention is reimagining the way companies work <Citation id="mckinseyInnovation" />. With many developments in this space, especially since the creation of the Agile Manifesto <Citation id="agileManifesto" />, new ways of working have come to light in recent years. Working methodologies of the past (most notably; waterfall) have slowly disappeared in favour of ones that are better at responding to change. This way of working has also changed how culture and information disperse in an organisation.

This research activity deconstructs organizations atomically. Meaning; we start by looking at the big picture, then zooming in. Thereafter we consider how this influences the way information spreads within an organization.

## Agile, Lean & Design Thinking — Better Together

Let's start by looking into modern working methodologies and mindsets. The resistance of large enterprises represses new ideas, and their siloed nature hinders cross-functional cooperation <Citation id="hbrEnterpriseInnovation" page="90-100" />. So, what is the key to a resilient, fast-changing organisation?

Victor Essnert of Doberman <Citation id="agileDoberman" /> explained the issues agile aims to solve. The Agile manifesto favours:

1. _Individuals and interactions_ over processes and tools
2. _Working software_ over comprehensive documentation
3. _Customer collaboration_ over contract negotiation
4. _Responding to change_ over following a plan

Victor continued his breakdown by showing how Agile works better together with Design Thinking and Lean. He explains how each of these mindsets help us with a mental framework at a specific stage during product development.

1. _Design Thinking_ is about exploring and solving problems
2. _Lean_ is to test and learn on our way to the right outcomes
3. _Agile_ is how we adapt to the ever-changing conditions we work in (especially with software)

At Hyper Island, we've been following many of Agile's principles too. Resilience — being able to respond to change — has been a central part of our curriculum. This has been deeply engrained in the culture of our crew.

## What is Culture?

John Seely Brown argues both _culture_ and _identity_ are significant aspects of learning and knowledge <Citation id="socialInformation" page="143-144" />. The culture of an organization is often hard to define. One issue is the invisibility of culture, as described by Spotify's Henrik Kniberg:

> Culture tends to be invisible. We don't notice it, because it's there all the time.
>
> - Henrik Kniberg <Citation id="spotifyCulture" hideAuthor />

Culture is something we have to actively look for in order to understand, analyse and change it.

Vimla Appadoo envisions culture as a bubble that sits around the systems, processes and people of an organization. Culture is what guides us to make decisions about the systems and processes we use. It empowers people to deliver their best work. She also voices three levels of culture, that fit in one another like a babushka doll <Citation id="appadooCulture" />.

1. Personal culture: all the things that make us diverse and unique
2. Team Culture: how a bunch of individuals work together to produce spectacular work
3. Business culture: how lots of teams work together, often united by their values

At Spotify, they favour community over hierarchical structure. Strong community can get away with an informal, volatile structure <Citation id="spotifyCulture" />. This ultimately leads us into the obvious question; _How do we maintain productivity without hierarchical structure?_ To answer this, we have to look into how autonomy interacts with alignment within organizations.

## Combining Autonomy and Productivity

Kniberg says autonomy is motivating and motivated people build better stuff <Citation id="spotifyCulture" />. That sounds compelling, but how do we ensure the vision of the company doesn't water down? How do we find the right balance between autonomy and being productive?

### Self-organised Teams

There is a perceived security in following traditional, hierarchical chains of command under the guise of reducing risks and maintaining efficiency <Citation id="parkerSelfOrganised" />.

### Autonomy & Alignment

Spotify thinks of this in two dimensions; autonomy vs. agency and alignment vs. authority. This is what each of these environments might look like:

1. _Low autonomy_ and _low alignment_: a typical micro-management culture; "shut up and follow orders"
2. _Low autonomy_ and _high alignment_: leaders are able to communicate the problem but also tell people how to solve it.
3. _High autonomy_ and _low alignment_: teams do whatever they want, leaders are helpless and the product becomes a Frankenstein
4. _High autonomy_ and _high alignment_: leaders define the problem, but let the teams figure out how to solve it

This environment of high autonomy and high alignment is what they call _aligned autonomy_. Strong alignment affords them to grant more autonomy <Citation id="spotifyCulture" />.

### Shaping Work

_Shape Up_ solidifies lots of these ideas. Ryan Singer describes that shaped work needs to find the right balance between concrete and abstract. The right level of abstraction is:

> \[C\]oncrete enough that the teams know what to do, yet abstract enough that they have room to work out the interesting details themselves
>
> - Ryan Singer <Citation id="shapeUp" hideAuthor />

Shaped work _shouldn't_ define what the result looks like, but should _clearly_ define the intended functionality or goal. They are clearly defined, rough ideas. Moreover, they define creative constraints and specify where the work ends. Shape Up enforces this by a mechanic Singer calls _appetite_. The shaping of work can't be planned or predicted, but shaped work can. Appetite settles how long we are willing to spend on the work. It makes us ask ourselves how much time this idea is worth to us <Citation id="shapeUp" />.

I've noticed that I've been doing this at Hyper Island too (especially during later projects). Our team would define tasks with some level of abstraction and refining the work individually or in smaller groups. We've essentially been shaping our own work together, which allowed us to split up work effectively. A prerequisite for this to succeed is that we trust each member will put in the work. The Hyper Island staff has handed us several tools to align as a team, underpinned by Susan Wheelan's theory for _creating effective teams_.

## Effective Teams

How team members behave is critical to the success of the team. What would an effective team look like? How should they act? What makes an effective team? One lens to increase our understanding of effective teams is Wheelan's *Integrated Model of Group Dynamics (IMGD). She defines four stages of group development <Citation id="wheelanEffective" />:

![Susan Wheelan Team Development Diagram. Left to Right: 1. Dependency and inclusion 2. Counter-dependency and fighting 3. Trust and structure 4. Work and productivity](/img/team-development.png "Figure: Susan Wheelan's Four Stages of Team Development")

Teams working together move through several stages as they continue working together. Team development looks different for every team and won't necessarily happen in a linear fashion. They may go through all of these stages, or only a few. Many groups will get stuck at some point. Even teams that have been working together effectively for a long time may (temporarily) regress as well.

### Team Termination

Additionally, Wheelan defines a fifth stage; termination. While this technically isn't a development stage, it's still an important step in team development. By consciously disbanding a team, we extract our learnings and give team members a sense of closure. Team termination concerns these points:

- Evaluating how successful the team was
- Evaluating how well the group functioned
- Expressing emotional support for team members
- Giving and receiving feedback to and from team members

### Focus of Effective Teams

Furthermore, Wheelan determined effective teams focus on 10 things:

1. Goals
2. Rules
3. Interdependence
4. Leadership
5. Communication and feedback
6. Discussion, decision making and planning
7. Implementation and evaluation
8. Norms and individual differences
9. Structure
10. Cooperation and conflict management

### Group Flow

Flow is a well established concept in psychology, done so by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi <Citation id="csikszentmihalyiFlow" hideAuthor />. Flow is defined as an optimal experience; a challenging activity that requires skill. They're activities that are goal-directed and bounded by rules. When flow state is reached, it completely consumes what we're doing and makes time pass without us noticing. Robert Keith Sawyer applies this same concept to groups <Citation id="sawyerFlow" />. He outlines ideal conditions for _group flow_ as:

1. Group goals
2. Close listening
3. Complete concentration
4. Being in control
5. Blending egos
6. Equal participation
7. Knowing team mates
8. Good communication
9. Being progress-oriented

People experience flow most commonly when in conversation with others, Csikszentmihalyi found. When this occurs, statements are genuinely unplanned responses to what we hear <Citation id="csikszentmihalyiFlow" hideAuthor />. Consequently, _group flow_ is more likely to emerge when everyone is fully engaged — at Hyper Island we call this _active listening_ <Citation id="sawyerFlow" />.

## Communication

When we zoom in even further, communication is the fabric that connects how teams work. Basecamp, a company that works 100% remotely, spends a lot effort to improve team work, culture and communication. In their list of principles, called _"How We Communicate"_, Basecamp co-founder Jason Fried writes:

> Few things are as important to study, practice, and perfect as clear communication
>
> - Jason Fried <Citation id="basecampComms" hideAuthor />

### Project & Reflect

### Asynchronous

Both co-founders (and likely their employees as well) are big advocates of asynchronous communication.

> Writing solidifies, chat dissolves.
>
> - Jason Fried <Citation id="basecampComms" hideAuthor />

### Balance

It's easy to overcompensate for this too. Vimla Appadoo said one of her biggest mistakes working at a new company was:

> Over doing and under communicating
>
> - Vimla Appadoo <Citation id="vimlaMistakes" hideAuthor />

## Collective Intelligence

At large organizations there is little chance of a common identity. Their members are too diverse, deeply engaged in different practices and spatially disconnected. Information and knowledge is formed locally and stored in a decentral clusters, as explained in _The Social Life of Information_:

> \[A\] work identity, even in multinational firms, is to a significant degree formed locally, where practitioners work together and practice is interdependent.
>
> - John Seely Brown <Citation id="socialInformation" page="144" hideAuthor />

- How knowledge and information spreads
- Loosely coupled but tightly aligned, how does that influence the way information spreads?
- Cross-pollination over standardization
  - That's how Figma, Slack and Google's Design Sprint became big
  - At hyper DM/DXD work together, in rotating teams within larger crew
- Persuading how we is better than me

## Looking at Others

There are two organizations I've been particularly interested in when it comes to work processes and methodologies. _Basecamp_ and _Spotify_. The founders and employees of Basecamp have released several books and documents that explain their way of working. Spotify on was applauded when they shared the work processes they employ in 2014 <Citation id="spotifyCulture" />.

### Basecamp

### Spotify

cross-functional teams, managed by function --> knowledge spreads easily inter- and intra-team

## Remote

> Real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time.
