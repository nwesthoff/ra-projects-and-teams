## Research

### Key ideas

- Spotify Model; What works about it? What doesn't?
  - Cross-functional teams with same-function management
- Breaking down hierarchical, bureaucratic orgs
- Diversity
- Collective intelligence
- Remote, the power of async communication/work

### Concrete learnings

1. Do split up work, and trust in your team mates's abilities (freight ship/speed boat metaphor)
2. Do reflections and invite feedback early and often
3. Each crew has a personality that is formed by the voices
4. Real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time
5. Me time and we time should be considered

### Questions

On Shape-Up

- Missing different perspectives, integrating disciplines and (ethnical) backgrounds
- Still feels pretty top-down, how might we let information flow to and from shapers?

General

- What's the currency within the culture? What gets traded and causes people to act?
- Persuading people that "we" is better than "me"

### Quotes

#### Shape Up

> Few things are as important to study, practice, and perfect as clear communication
>
> - [source](https://basecamp.com/guides/how-we-communicate)

> We needed language to describe what we were doing and more structure to keep doing it at our new scale

Balance between formalizing and autonomy:

> We formalized our pitching and betting processes

Relate to this with hyper’s short projects:

> \[S\]ix-week cycles. Six weeks is long enough to build something meaningful start-to-finish and short enough that everyone can feel the deadline looming from the start

Again, autonomy vs agency:

> \[R\]ight level of abstraction: concrete enough that the teams know what to do, yet abstract enough that they have room to work out the interesting details themselves

> \[S\]peak frankly and jump from one promising position to another. It’s that kind of private, rough, early work

> An appetite is completely different from an estimate. Estimates start with a design and end with a number. Appetites start with a number and end with a design. We use the appetite as a creative constraint on the design process

Hard decision to make, but really powerful:

> If it’s not critical now and we can’t get our hands around the problem, we’ll walk away from it and work on something else. Maybe in the future a new request or story will pop up that gives us better insight into the problem

#### Spotify Culture

> Culture tends to be invisible. We don't notice it, because it's there all the time.

> Agile matters more than scrum, and principles matter more than specific scrum practices

Autonomy is motivating, and motivated people build better stuff
The vision of Spotify is more important than any squad. The goal is to be autonomous, but don' t suboptimize:

> It's kind of like a jazz-band. Although each musician is autonomous and plays his own instrument. They listen to each other and focus on the whole song together.

Loosely coupled, but tightligh aligned squads.

Cross-pollination > standardisation. 

<small>Note: that's how Figma, Slack and Google's Design Sprint became big.</small>

Community > hierarchical structure. Strong community can get away with an informal, volatile structure.

> If you need to know exactly who is making decisions, you are in the wrong place.



#### Social Life of Information

> In a similar vein, there’s been a lot of talk about organizational “culture” and members’ “identity” as if these were uniform, too. As we argued in chapter five, both culture and identity are significant aspects of learning and knowledge.
>

> \[A\] work identity, even in multinational firms, is to a significant degree formed locally, where practitioners work together and practice is interdepen- dent.

Large organizations stand little chance of forging much of a common identity. Its members are too diverse, too deeply engaged in different practices, and located in too many places.Employees, then, don’t simply become members of the Xerox Corporation. They become members of its different communities of practice—technical representatives, engineers, research managers, or sales analysts.



The creation of local knowl- edge, then, is likely to create simultaneously problems for coordina- tion. In general, the formal requirements of process and a little creative “processing” (see chapter four) smoothes over such problems. As a

result, they are likely to dampen (or at least make invisible) creativity.



#### McKinsey Traditional company, new businesses

##### Change is accelerating

Modern businesses have to respond to changing business conditions at an increasing rate. As a result, business process modelling and improvement is becoming a serious challenge (Hillenbrand et al., 2019). As established companies get thrown over by digital powerhouses many are reinventing themselves through a dual effort to digitise their legacy businesses and create new enterprises (Hillenbrand et al., 2019).

Innovation like this requires seamless collaboration across different parts of a business. In most large corporations however, innovation and integration are unnatural acts. The resistance of large enterprises represses new ideas, and their siloed nature hinders cross-functional cooperation (Cash, Earl and Morison, 2008). McKinsey also observed, that rather than a shortage of inspiration, older companies’ main challenges are an excess of institutional control and an inability to scale up innovations. So, what is the key to a resilient, fast-changing organisation?

##### Innovation-labs

McKinsey has identified an essential process to successfully build resilience against disruption, an in- house innovation-lab. Their purpose; building and scaling up their own disruptive new businesses, that many corporates and incubators normally don’t. Their success is three-fold:

- Collect resources and talent to steer the early stages of growth
- Act as a buffer that shields them from the bureaucratic nature of enterprises
- Reap the benefits of the parent company’s scale

##### Formula for success

A winning formula for building new businesses combines the methods and pace of successful tech startups with the scale of long-standing companies.

- Large market that can be unlocked in incremental steps
- Technology model that takes advantage of ecosystems
- Clear path toward attractive monetisation
