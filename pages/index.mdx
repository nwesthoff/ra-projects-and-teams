A big part of that reinvention is reimagining the way companies work <Citation id="mckinseyInnovation" />. With many developments in this space, especially since the creation of the Agile Manifesto <Citation id="agileManifesto" />, new ways of working have come to light in recent years. Working methodologies of the past (most notably; waterfall) have slowly disappeared in favour of ones that are better at responding to change. This way of working has also changed how culture and information disperse in an organisation.

## Agile, Lean & Design Thinking — Better Together

Let's start by looking into new working methodologies and mindsets. The resistance of large enterprises represses new ideas, and their siloed nature hinders cross-functional cooperation <Citation id="hbrEnterpriseInnovation" page="90-100" />. So, what is the key to a resilient, fast-changing organisation?

Victor Essnert of Doberman <Citation id="agileDoberman" /> explained the issues agile aims to solve. The Agile manifesto favours:

1. _Individuals and interactions_ over processes and tools
2. _Working software_ over comprehensive documentation
3. _Customer collaboration_ over contract negotiation
4. _Responding to change_ over following a plan

Victor continued his breakdown by showing how Agile works better together with Design Thinking and Lean. He explains how each of these mindsets help us with a mental framework at a specific stage during product development.

1. _Design Thinking_ is about exploring and solving problems
2. _Lean_ is to test and learn on our way to the right outcomes
3. _Agile_ is how we adapt to the ever-changing conditions we work in (especially with software)

At Hyper Island, we've been following many of Agile's principles too. Resilience — being able to respond to change — has been a central part of our curriculum. We have been handed several tools to do that together as a team, underpinned by Susan Wheelan's theory for _creating effective teams_.

## Effective Teams

What would an effective team look like? How should they act? What makes an effective team? First of all, Susan Wheelan defines four stages of group development <Citation id="wheelanEffective" />.

Teams working together move through several stages as they continue working together.  Team development looks different for every team and won't necessarily happen in a linear fashion. They may go through all of these stages, or only a few. Many groups will get stuck at some point. Even teams that have been working together effectively for a long time may (temporarily) regress as well.

### Team Termination

Additionally, Wheelan defines a fifth stage; termination. While this technically isn't a development stage, it's still an important step in team development. By consciously disbanding a team, we extract our learnings and give team members a sense of closure. Team termination is about the evaluation of the team and concerns:

- How successful the group was
- How well the group functioned
- Expressing emotional support for team members
- Giving and receiving feedback to and from team members

### Focus of Effective Teams

Furthermore, Wheelan determined effective teams focus on 10 things:

1. Goals
2. Rules
3. Interdependence
4. Leadership
5. Communication and feedback
6. Discussion, decision making and planning
7. Implementation and evaluation
8. Norms and individual differences
9. Structure
10. Cooperation and conflict management

### Group Flow

Flow is a well established concept in psychology, established by Csikszentmihalyi <Citation id="csikszentmihalyiFlow" hideAuthor />. Flow is defined as an optimal experience; a challenging activity that requires skill. They're activities that are goal-directed and bounded by rules. Robert Keith Sawyer takes this concept a step further <Citation id="sawyerFlow" />. He establishes ideal conditions for *group flow*:

1. Group goals
2. Close listening
3. Complete concentration
4. Being in control
5. Blending egos
6. Equal participation
7. Knowing team mates
8. Good communication
9. Being progress-oriented

People experience flow most commonly when in conversation with others, Csikszentmihalyi found. When this occurs, statements are genuinely unplanned responses to what we hear. Consequently, *group flow* is more likely to emerge when everyone is fully engaged — at Hyper Island we call this *active listening*.

## Communication

Basecamp, a company that works 100% remotely, spends a lot effort to improve team work, culture and communication. In their manifesto called *"How We Communicate"*, Basecamp co-founder Jason Fried writes:

> Few things are as important to study, practice, and perfect as clear communication
>
> - Jason Fried <Citation id="basecampComms" hideAuthor />

Both co-founders (and likely their employees as well) are big advocates of asynchronous communication. 

> Writing solidifies, chat dissolves. 
>
> - Jason Fried <Citation id="basecampComms" hideAuthor />

It's easy to overcompensate for this too. Vimla Appadoo said one of her biggest mistakes working at a new company was:

> Over doing and under communicating
>
> - Vimla Appadoo <Citation id="vimlaCulture" hideAuthor />



## What is Culture?

We have previously established how (many) organizations and effective teams work. John Seely Brown argues both *culture* and *identity* are significant aspects of learning and knowledge <Citation id="socialInformation" page="143-144" />, so that's what we'll look into next. 

How can we get a better idea of an organization's culture? One issue is the invisibility of culture, as described by Spotify's Henrik Kniberg:

> Culture tends to be invisible. We don't notice it, because it's there all the time.
>
> - Henrik Kniberg <Citation id="spotifyCulture" hideAuthor />

Culture is something we have to actively look for in order to understand, analyse and change it.

At Spotify, they favour community over hierarchical structure. Strong community can get away with an informal, volatile structure <Citation id="spotifyCulture" />. This ultimately leads us into the obvious question; _How do we maintain productivity without hierarchical structure?_ To answer this, we have to look into how autonomy interacts with alignment within organizations.

## Autonomy & Alignment

Autonomy is motivating, and motivated people build better stuff <Citation id="spotifyCulture" />

Autonomy vs. Agency

Alignment vs. Authority

> Be stubborn on the vision, but flexible on the details
>
> - Jeff Bezos

## Collective Intelligence

At large organizations there is little chance of a common identity. Their members are too diverse, deeply engaged in different practices and spatially disconnected. Information and knowledge is decentral, formed locally, as explained in The Social Life of Information:

> \[A\] work identity, even in multinational firms, is to a significant degree formed locally, where practitioners work together and practice is interdependent.
>
> - John Seely Brown <Citation id="socialInformation" page="144" hideAuthor />

- How knowledge and information spreads
- Cross-pollination over standardization
  - That's how Figma, Slack and Google's Design Sprint became big
- Persuading how we is better than me

## Looking at Others

There are two organizations I've been particularly interested in when it comes to work processes and methodologies. _Basecamp_ and _Spotify_. The founders and employees of Basecamp have released several books and documents that explain their way of working. Spotify on was applauded when they shared the work processes they employ in 2014 <Citation id="spotifyCulture" />.

### Basecamp

### Spotify

cross-functional teams, managed by function --> knowledge spreads easily inter- and intra-team

## Remote

> Real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time.
